Here i need to check 3 things:

Receiving the informations:
- using recv, it has a bufffer where i allocate all infos received
- Pass it to the next parsers

AParser
- Everything is a parser, so we create an abstract class, base for all others

ParserMethod
- 3 options: {"GET", "POST", "DELETE"}

ParserPath
- More open

ParserHTTPType
- 2 options: {"http 1.1", "http 1.0"}

ParserEndLine
- 1 option: { "/r/n" }

create a simple structure that parse_anything and where time i want an specific PARSER I pass the list of possible options
